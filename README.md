A website designed to help people better understand common pathfinding algorithms in a visual way. 

Try it here: https://not-younger.github.io/Path-Finding-Visualizer/

Project idea came from Clement Mihailescu, but completely reverse engineered by myself and I improved the user experience dramatically by overcoming certain bugs his website had in terms of placing obstacles. I used HTML, CSS, and native Javascript with no external libraries.

Pathfinding Algorithms:
- Depth-first Search
- Breadth-first Search
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Search

Maze Generation
- Prim's Algorithm
- Random obstace maze
- Random weight maze (for weighted algorithms)

SVG Icons made by me
- Start, target, weight, caret

Hope you enjoy!
